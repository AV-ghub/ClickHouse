# Default and Maximum Part Size in ClickHouse
## Default Part Size:
ClickHouse does not enforce a strict default size for parts. Instead, the size of parts depends on:

The amount of data inserted in a single insert operation.

The table engine being used (e.g., MergeTree, ReplicatedMergeTree).

The settings for merge operations (e.g., max_bytes_to_merge_at_max_space_in_pool).

Typically, small inserts (e.g., a few rows) will create small parts, while larger inserts will create larger parts.

## Maximum Part Size:

ClickHouse does not have a hard-coded maximum part size. However, the size of parts is indirectly controlled by:

Insert batch size: Larger inserts create larger parts.

Merge settings: ClickHouse merges smaller parts into larger ones, but the size of merged parts is controlled by settings like max_bytes_to_merge_at_max_space_in_pool.

## Settings Controlling Part Size

Here are the key settings that influence part size and merge behavior in ClickHouse:

### max_partitions_to_read:

Limits the number of partitions that can be read in a single query. This indirectly affects how large parts can grow within a partition.

### max_bytes_to_merge_at_max_space_in_pool:

Controls the maximum size of a part that can be created during a merge operation. Default is 150 GB.

If the merged part exceeds this size, ClickHouse will not merge the parts.

### max_partitions_to_read:

Limits the number of partitions that can be read in a single query. This indirectly affects how large parts can grow within a partition.

### min_bytes_for_wide_part and min_rows_for_wide_part:

These settings determine when ClickHouse switches from storing data in a "compact" format to a "wide" format.

#### Defaults:

* min_bytes_for_wide_part: 10 MB

* min_rows_for_wide_part: 10,000,000 rows

Larger parts are stored in the "wide" format, which is more efficient for large datasets.

### max_insert_block_size:

Controls the maximum number of rows that can be inserted in a single block. Default is 1,048,576 rows.

Larger blocks can lead to larger parts.

### merge_max_block_size:

Controls the maximum block size during merge operations. Default is 8192 rows.

### max_parts_in_total:

Limits the total number of parts in a table. If this limit is exceeded, ClickHouse will prevent further inserts. Default is 100,000.

### max_partitions_to_read:

Limits the number of partitions that can be read in a single query. This indirectly affects how large parts can grow within a partition.

## Practical Recommendations
Avoid too many small parts: Too many small parts can degrade query performance and increase merge overhead. Use larger insert batches to create fewer, larger parts.

Monitor part sizes: Use the system.parts table to monitor part sizes and merge behavior:

```sql
SELECT table, partition, name, rows, bytes_on_disk
FROM system.parts
WHERE active
ORDER BY bytes_on_disk DESC;
```

Adjust merge settings: If you have large datasets, consider increasing max_bytes_to_merge_at_max_space_in_pool to allow larger merges.

Example: Checking Part Sizes
To see the current parts and their sizes in a table, you can query the system.parts table:

```sql
SELECT
    table,
    partition,
    name,
    rows,
    bytes_on_disk,
    modification_time
FROM system.parts
WHERE table = 'your_table_name'
ORDER BY bytes_on_disk DESC;
```
